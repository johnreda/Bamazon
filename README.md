# Bamazon

### This is a demo of my Bamazon Customer node application.

#### The application starts by bringing up a menu of items, all populated from a database stored in DataGrip.
#### Once the menu is displayed, the application will ask the user to select the ID of the product, followed by the quantity they wish to order.

#### Once the user inputs their selection, the application calculates the total based on the price of the product and the         quantity ordered.

#### The database is automatically updated to relfect the new stock quantity after the order has been placed.

### In the event the user wishes to order more than the amount currently in stock, they are presented a message telling them there is insufficient stock.
